Battlefield 2 Unlocks hack
=====================

IMPORTANT NOTICE START

Since the Gamespy shutdown of their Battlefield 2 servers, this solution no longer works. I will keep the repository open until I can confirm that the code wont ever be useful again. There is a interesting project over at battlelog.co, but I am uncertain whether it will allow you to setup servers with all unlocks enabled.

If anyone figures this out, please tell me!

IMPORTANT NOTICE END


Server software for 'cheating' a local Battlefield 2 server to allow all weapons unlocked for all players.

This was uploaded prematurely. I don't consider the quality of this code to be very good, but it works.

To install the hacked Battlefield 2 Dedicated Server, run install.
To run the Battlefield 2 Dedicated Server, run the start.sh from the installation.

To run the unlockproxy, run unlockproxy.

Remember to add the following to your hosts-file (this will break the local Battlefield 2 server, if the unlockproxy is not running):
127.0.0.1 bf2web.gamespy.com
